Important:
1. Your security layer should produce no output. If it does, it will fail the autograder.
2. Remember that filenames can only contain lower case letters and numbers.
3. Your reference monitor must be named reference_monitor_netid.r2py. Any other names will not
work with the autograder.
4. If the autograder performs weirdly, please report it to Kevin Gallagher or the TA.
